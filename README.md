# Rishabh's dmenu

This is just my build of dmenu. Nothing special, don't bother starring ;-)

Only changes are minor config ones: bigger font and different colors.

This has default alpha patch with it. So, it does not crash with using -w with transparent st

## Installation

After making any config changes that you want, but `make`, `sudo make install` it.
